# Impact Lab Wellington — Team 9

## Problem 03 — Identify and verify emerging local impacts from public information

> How might we use public online information to identify where emergency impacts may be emerging, while making the reliability and limitations of that information clear?

A prototype could collect relevant public posts, local news and community reports; identify likely locations and issue types; and show where several independent sources appear to describe the same event — presenting signals for an intelligence team to investigate, never social-media content as verified fact.

**Desired outcome:** WCC can detect possible impacts earlier and direct staff attention to matters needing confirmation.

## What we're building

One working prototype, demoed in four minutes at 16:30.

Each team's module is meant to slot into a shared **common operating picture** —
a live map of emergency signals that the ten prototypes feed together. Aim for
something that can be pointed at a map, a feed or an API, rather than a
closed-off demo.

Two teams work each problem statement independently. That's deliberate: two
honest attempts at the same problem tell WCC more than one.

## Data

The public GIS datasets Wellington City Council Emergency Management shared are
catalogued, checked and made queryable here:

- **Catalogue + SDK** — https://github.com/claudecommunity-nz/wcc-emergency-gis-data
- **Browse the datasets** — https://claudecommunity-nz.github.io/wcc-emergency-gis-data/

74 datasets: flood, landslide, earthquake, tsunami, coastal inundation and
climate layers, plus emergency hubs, post-quake road reopening order, water
tanks, deprivation by area, and live river-level and rainfall telemetry.
`wcc_gis.py` is a single file with no dependencies — copy it and
`catalogue.json` into your project.

```python
import wcc_gis

wcc_gis.ids("tsunami")                                    # find datasets
wcc_gis.features("tsunami-evacuation-zones", at=(-41.2790, 174.7804))
wcc_gis.geojson("footpaths", bbox=wcc_gis.WELLINGTON)     # straight into MapLibre
wcc_gis.hilltop_data("Hutt River at Taita Gorge", "Flow")[-1]
```

Three traps worth knowing before you lose an hour to them:

- Everything is published in **NZTM2000, not lat/lng**. Request raw and your
  pins land off the coast of Africa. Always ask for `outSR=4326`.
- **A quarter of the layers are rasters** that advertise a query capability,
  then refuse to answer. Ask them for a PNG instead.
- **One query is silently capped** (`footpaths` has 8,130 features; a request
  returns 2,000). Page properly, or check `exceededTransferLimit`.

## Ground rules

- These are **hazard-planning layers, not live emergency information**.
  In an emergency, call 111.
- **The data is not ours.** Each dataset belongs to its publisher — WCC, Greater
  Wellington, GNS Science, NIWA, Wellington Water, MBIE, NZTA, MetService.
  Licence terms vary per dataset; check the dataset's page before publishing
  anything derived from it, and credit the publisher.
- Be considerate with request rates. These are council servers, and at least one
  host throttles under concurrent load.
- **Keep personal details out of this repo.** It is public. No participant
  names, contact details or application material.
- Treat public social content as a *signal to investigate*, never as verified
  fact — surfacing something unverified as confirmed is the failure mode these
  problem statements are most wary of.

## Licence

Code here is MIT unless stated otherwise. The data is not covered by it.
