# Impact Lab Wellington — Team 9

Context for Claude Code working in this repo.

## The event

A one-day build with Wellington City Council Emergency Management, Saturday
8 August 2026, at the Waimanga Room, Wellington City Council. Ten teams, five
problem statements, two teams per statement. Each team ships one working
prototype and demos it for four minutes.

## Timeline for the day

| Time | What |
|---|---|
| 08:00 | Arrival and mingle |
| 09:00 | Opening address & problem briefing |
| 09:30 | Build begins |
| 12:30 | Lunch + lightning talks |
| 16:00 | Submissions close |
| 16:30 | Demos + judging |
| 17:45 | Awards + next steps |

Build time is roughly six and a half hours, minus lunch. Scope accordingly:
a narrow thing that works beats a broad thing that doesn't demo.

## This team's problem — 03: Identify and verify emerging local impacts from public information

> How might we use public online information to identify where emergency impacts may be emerging, while making the reliability and limitations of that information clear?

A prototype could collect relevant public posts, local news and community reports; identify likely locations and issue types; and show where several independent sources appear to describe the same event. It would not present social-media content as verified fact. It would identify signals for an intelligence team to investigate.

There may be an opportunity to develop this option in collaboration with doctoral research at Massey University's Joint Centre for Disaster Research, on multimodal generative AI for disaster situational awareness using social media. Early discussions with the WCC Emergency Management team have already identified possible overlap. Any collaboration would need to be agreed with the researcher and Massey University.

**Desired outcome:** WCC can detect possible impacts earlier and direct staff attention to matters needing confirmation.

All five statements sit inside one frame: the common theme is improving the flow and use of information between communities and Council before and during an event.

## What success looks like

Each prototype is a module in a shared **common operating picture**: a live map
of emergency signals. Prefer outputs that compose — GeoJSON, a feed, an
endpoint — over a self-contained UI that nothing else can read.

Judging is on a four-minute demo. Something running and pointed at real
Wellington data will land better than architecture that isn't finished.

## Data

The public GIS datasets Wellington City Council Emergency Management shared are
catalogued, checked and made queryable here:

- **Catalogue + SDK** — https://github.com/claudecommunity-nz/wcc-emergency-gis-data
- **Browse the datasets** — https://claudecommunity-nz.github.io/wcc-emergency-gis-data/

74 datasets: flood, landslide, earthquake, tsunami, coastal inundation and
climate layers, plus emergency hubs, post-quake road reopening order, water
tanks, deprivation by area, and live river-level and rainfall telemetry.
`wcc_gis.py` is a single file with no dependencies — copy it and
`catalogue.json` into your project.

```python
import wcc_gis

wcc_gis.ids("tsunami")                                    # find datasets
wcc_gis.features("tsunami-evacuation-zones", at=(-41.2790, 174.7804))
wcc_gis.geojson("footpaths", bbox=wcc_gis.WELLINGTON)     # straight into MapLibre
wcc_gis.hilltop_data("Hutt River at Taita Gorge", "Flow")[-1]
```

Three traps worth knowing before you lose an hour to them:

- Everything is published in **NZTM2000, not lat/lng**. Request raw and your
  pins land off the coast of Africa. Always ask for `outSR=4326`.
- **A quarter of the layers are rasters** that advertise a query capability,
  then refuse to answer. Ask them for a PNG instead.
- **One query is silently capped** (`footpaths` has 8,130 features; a request
  returns 2,000). Page properly, or check `exceededTransferLimit`.

## Constraints that matter here

- **Hazard-planning data, not live emergency information.** Nothing built today
  should be presented as an operational emergency source. In an emergency, 111.
- **Show reliability, don't hide it.** Several of these problem statements are
  explicitly about making limitations visible. If the prototype infers or
  aggregates, say so in the interface. Never present an unverified public post
  as confirmed fact.
- **This repo is public and must stay free of personal information** — no
  participant names, contact details, or anything from the application process.
- **Attribution.** Data belongs to its publishers and licences vary per dataset.
  Check before publishing anything derived.

## Conventions

- Keep the README's problem statement in sync if the scope shifts during the day.
- Commit early and often — the repo is the submission.
